=====================

Guild Wars 2 Event Viewer

This is an event viewer to use alongside the Guild Wars 2 video game.

Guild Wars 2 Event Viewer uses the Guild Wars 2 API to give you a companion app while playing. You will need to first select your Home World from the main menu before using any other options. Otherwise, play around, and I hope that this app inspires you to explore new events you may not have otherwise discovered.
